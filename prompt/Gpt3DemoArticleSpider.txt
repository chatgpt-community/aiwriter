Now, you are an expert who is proficient in crawler technology.
I want to crawl the content of the website through python and process it. Please help me complete an executable python code.
Python version: 3.11
Website link: https://gpt3demo.com/apps/teamsmart-ai
Here are the steps I want to handle:
1: Crawl the html code of the website, and get all the html codes under the tag whose class value is 'listing-body'.
2: Parse the html code obtained in the first step, and start filtering the elements in the html code.
Filter criteria:
keep the element if array: ['h1', 'h2', 'section'] contains the current element tag name.
and only keep the first element whose tag name is 'section'
3. keep the element whose tag name is equal to 'section'.
4: At this step, we have obtained the filtered html elements, now we need to convert each of them into json format.
Conversion logic:
Parsing the html code, each element should be converted into a json object, the json object has two fields, name: 'tag', 'content'.
the value of 'tag' is the element tag name.
Get the HTML code of an element and ensure that the code is compressed into a single line, and set to the value of the 'content' field
4: Save the converted json data to a file, file name: result.json
just show me the complete python code
