Now, you are an expert who is proficient in crawler technology.
I want to crawl the content of the website through python and process it. Please help me complete an executable python code.
Python version: 3.11
Website link: https://gpt3demo.com/apps/teamsmart-ai
Here are the steps I want to handle:
1: Crawl the html code of the website, and get all the html codes under the tag whose class value is 'listing-body'.
2: Parse the html code obtained in the first step, and start filtering the elements in the html code.
Filter criteria:
if array: ['h1','h2','section'] contains the current element tag name, keep the element,
if there are multiple elements with the tag named 'section', only the first one is kept
3: At this step, we have obtained the filtered html elements, now we need to convert each of them into json format.
Conversion logic:
Parsing the html code, each element should be converted into a json object, the json object has two fields, namely: 'tag', 'content'
the value of the 'tag' field is the tag name of the element, and the value of the 'content' field is the text content of the current element
4: Save the converted json data to a file, file name: result.json
just show me the complete python code
